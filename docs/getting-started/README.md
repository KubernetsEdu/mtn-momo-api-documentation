# Getting Started

In order to use the API platform, you will need to register for an account [here]( https://momodeveloper.mtn.com/). An account activation link will be sent in an email to the email address you used in registering for a developer account; the activation link expires within 24 hours of it being sent.

After you have activated your account, and logged in, click on your “Username” at the top of the login page; select “PROFILE” from the drop down list. You should then be able to subscibe to a product.

In the next section, we shall provision an API User and Key.

### Note:

An account activation link will be sent in an email to the email address you used in registering for a developer account; the activation link expires within 24 hours of it being sent, and you will need to register for another account. The account activation link enables you to activate your developer account and set a password for your account.
